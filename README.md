# PythonResearch

Raspberry Pi research project conducted with Prof. John Koelzer at Rockhurst University
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the project was to accurately measure both visual and auditory reaction times of the user. The program was able to trigger both lights and buzzers and allow the
user to input when they hear each one.

The code was run using Python3 on a Raspberry Pi 4. A breadboard was used so that the program could activate a light and buzzer through a connection with the Pi's GPIO pins. It 
also allowed the user to input their reaction via a button on the breadboard.
